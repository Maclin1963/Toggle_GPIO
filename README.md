This is a script for building a webserver on ESP32, to show a toggle switch on the web srver,
and control the GPIO output once user log into the web page.
By deploying another shell script on a PC or Raspberry Pi to handle the accessibility and 
inquery to the webserver, the automation control through whatever web browser to the switch
of your device in your home is achieveable.
No copy right, welcome to copy and use the code if you deem useful.
